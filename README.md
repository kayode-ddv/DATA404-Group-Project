# DATA404-Group-Project
If an appropriately named subdirectory is not available feel free to add one, or email me at kayode.dunkelvance@bison.howard.edu and I will add it for you. The first subdirectories are categorical any futher subdirecties should be made to distinguish the intention or purpose of the code or specificity of the data within that directory.

  -  All python code needs to go under the general "Code" directory. Currently the "Code" subdirectories are "Analysis", "Data Acquisition", "Preprocessing", and "Visualization".

  -  All data needs to go under the "Data" directory. Currently the "Data" subdirectories are "Raw", "Preprocessed", and "Finalized".
